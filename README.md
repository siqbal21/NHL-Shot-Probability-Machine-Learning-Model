# 🏒 NHL Shot Probability Machine Learning Model  

This project explores how **expected goals (xG) models** calculate the probability of scoring in the NHL by analyzing real shot data from the 2023–2024 season. Using a machine learning approach, I investigated how factors like **shot distance, angle, and rebound status** influence goal probability.

### 🌟 Inspiration  
As a longtime FIFA/EAFC enthusiast, I was always fascinated by the **expected goals (xG)** statistic in the match facts screen. Over time, I noticed this statistic gaining relevance not just in soccer (football) but also in hockey and other sports. This project grew out of my curiosity to better understand how expected goals are calculated and how machine learning models can be applied to replicate and analyze this widely used statistic.

### 🚀 Results & Insights  
- Confirmed that **shot distance** and **shot angle** are strong predictors of scoring probability.  
- Identified the importance of **rebound shots** as high-value scoring opportunities.

### 📊 Project Overview  
- Analyzed over a season’s worth of NHL shot data to study the foundations of expected goals models.  
- Built visualizations in Python using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** to uncover trends and patterns in shot quality.  
- Created scatter plots, bar charts, regression lines, and heat maps that reveal how different variables affect scoring chances.  
- Designed and implemented a simplified **logistic regression model** to estimate goal probability based on shot characteristics.

### 📫 Future Work  
- Experiment with more advanced models (e.g., Random Forests or Neural Networks).
- Incorporate more variables like goalie positioning, game state, and time of event.
- Expand the dataset across multiple seasons to improve accuracy.
